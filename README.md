# Oomor: The All-in-One Super App for Commerce and Services

## Core Concept

Oomor is a Super App where small businesses and individuals can create their own mini-apps (subdomains) inside one platform.  
It combines e-commerce, services, and personal storefronts â€” all managed from a single, unified interface.

## Main Features

### 1. SaaS E-Commerce Builder

- Each user/business gets a customizable storefront (mini app).
- Built-in payment gateway, shipping management, customer chat.
- Add-ons like print-on-demand (T-shirts, socks), pickling service, healthy meal subscriptions, etc.

### 2. Marketplace

- Shops/products are searchable and discoverable inside the Oomor marketplace.

### 3. Services Hub

Beyond shopping, users can access services like:

_Think of it like an app store but for small businesses and services._

- Some can even upgrade into full micro-apps within Oomor (if they grow big enough).

### 5. Personalization & AI
